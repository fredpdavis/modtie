 MODTIE predicts binary protein interactions and higher-order protein
 complexes from a set of protein sequences based on their similarity to
 template complexes of known structure. It can be used for genome-wide
 prediction, through interaction with the MODBASE database of comparative
 models (http://salilab.org/modbase), or to score individual protein
 complexes. This package contains the software that implements the method.

 MODTIE v1.11 uses:
 * template structures from PIBASE v2010
 * domain definitions from SCOP v1.75


o Using MODTIE
--------------
 This package contains the software used to make predictions using MODTIE.
 Three programs are included for typical prediction purposes:

 1. runmodtie.modbase.pl - Predict interactions between protein sequences
                           using comparative models available in MODBASE

 2. runmodtie.targetstrxs_template.pl - Score interactions between two
                  protein structures given a template complex structure

 3. runmodtie.scorecomplex.pl - Score the structure of a protein complex

 The code is mostly in Perl, with some C code for more expensive computations.
 A users manual is provided describing the installation procedure and three
 typical run modes.


o Downloading MODTIE

o History
---------
 MODTIE was developed at the University of California, San Francisco in the
 laboratory of Andrej Sali (http://salilab.org) and continued at the
 Janelia Research Campus of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute
 (http://janelia.org).

 Changes
 -------
 * v1.11  adjusts for new residue numbering scheme in MODBASE
 * v1.1   upgrade to new PIBASE v2010 and SCOP domains v1.75
